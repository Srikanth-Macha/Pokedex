An app to explore Pok√©mon world.

Are you one those people who watched Pokemon a lot and wanted to just takeout a PokeBall and start battling with your pokemon as a kid, then this app will make you feel nostalgic.

Do you remember the device that trainers use to know more about pokemons they saw?
Yes, Pokedex. That's what this app is about, you can find everything about your favorite pokemons here and also find stuff that you would normally find in pokemon games only.
